# FinTrack- Financial Tracker
Made at codefusion 24h hackathon at pesuecc

## Overview:

CodeFusion was a 24 hour hackathon with two simultaneous halves. One half was a CTF challenge which was handled beautifully by Vinaayak G Dasika and Nimalan from my team who came first in that half.
The other half was product creation where Aditi Vignesh and I made a website for finance tracking of individuals as well as groups with expense tracking, budgets, hierarchies and approvals. 
Our team ended up placing second overall.

## My role:

Developed scalable backend using django with a structured database and handled the entire backend of the implementation.
